		<h3 style = "font-family:courier;"><font size="4">COPYRIGHT DESIGN AND PATENTS ACT 1998</h3>
			<p style ="font-family:verdana;"><font size="2.5"> The Copyright Design and Patents Act 1998 contains multiple principles including the duration of rights of owning music and types of work being covered. 
			To summarise this, music, books, video and software can all be covered by copyright law. </p>
			<p style ="font-family:verdana;"><font size="2.5"> Below are some actions that are forbidden when purchasing software: </p>

					<LI> Using the software on a network, unless the licence allows it. </LI>
					<p></p>
					<LI> Renting the software without the permission of the copyright holder. </LI>
					<p></p>
				</OL>
					<p style ="font-family:verdana;"><font size="2.5"> In addition, since The Copyright Design and Patents Act 1998 is quite extensive, 
					it also contains the duration of rights for each type of work as listed below: </p>
						<OL style = "font-family:verdana;"><font size ="2.5">
							<LI> For literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works </LI>

		<h3 style = "font-family:courier;"><font size="4">REGULATION OF INVESTIGATORY POWERS ACT 2000</h3>
			<p style ="font-family:verdana;"><font size="2.5"> The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (also known as RIPA) was legislated so that UK surveillance laws and practice can protect 
			the individual's rights to privacy. </p>
			<p style ="font-family:verdana;"><font size="2.5"> In relation to RIPA, an upcoming draft act proposed as Draft Communications Data Bill (also known as Snooper's Charter) is a draft 
			legislation that is stated to protect online data by collecting ecords of each user's internet browsing activity (including social media), email correspondence, voice calls, internet gaming, 
			and mobile phone messaging services and store the records for 12 months. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p style ="font-family:verdana;"><font size="2.5"> RIPA can be broken down into two summarised sections: </p>
				<OL style = "font-family:verdana;"><font size ="2.5">
					<LI> RIPA includes at least two highly controversial stipulations: first, that individuals or organizations may be compelled by the government (presumably through some writ or subpoena) 
					to disclose keys necessary to decrypt encrypted communications whose content may be suspect or provide evidence of illegal activity. </LI>
					<p></p>
					<LI> Internet Service Providers should bear the cost of technical systems to assist law enforcement with interception of electronic communications. </LI>
					<p></p>
				</OL>
					<p style ="font-family:verdana;"><font size="2.5"> However, neither of these stipulations has been put into practice, nor tested in the courts. Based on a 2003 extension to RIPA coverage, 
					it may be invoked by a great many legal entities including not only governments at all levels, but also job centers, local councils, and the Chief Inspector of Schools. </p>
